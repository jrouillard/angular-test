## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
It requires an empty localstorage. 
`localStorage.clear()` in the console or uncomment the app.ts line to clear the storage each time the app runs

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
